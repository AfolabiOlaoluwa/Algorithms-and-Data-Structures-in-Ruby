# codility
This repository contains ruby implementation of solutions of questions featured in Lessons section of Codility. 
Each solution is compiled and checked on Codility and possess 100% correctness and 100% performance. 
Some questions are solved with 2 different approaches, Each of the solution is 100% correct and 100% in performance but the later solution is easy to understand and is cleaner.
